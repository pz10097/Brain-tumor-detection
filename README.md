# Brain-tumor-detection

Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection containing MRI brain images. Program is built in Pyton and it's libraries: keras, sklearn, numpy, PIL. It detects brain tumor with around 90% accuracy based on MRI image. Before uploading images, they were cropped in external program to reduce their size. To create more data for training, ImageDataGenerator for image augmentation was used. For tumor detecion VGG16 model was used.
